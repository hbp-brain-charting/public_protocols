Video annotations of the runs, for the two MRI sessions dedicated to this protocol, are available under the tab `Releases` of the repository with the tag "raiders_annotations_v1.0". The film --2009 DVD edition of the movie *Raiders of the Lost Ark* dubbed to french-- is displayed onto a gray background as part of the stimuli presented to the participants. The movie ends with 10 seconds of a fixation cross.
