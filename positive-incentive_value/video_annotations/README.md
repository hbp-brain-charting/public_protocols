Each video presents the sequence of visual stimuli for one single run. Each run was in turn dedicated to the evaluation of a specific category of items. There were two sequences per category and each sequence contained different items. Thus, there were two runs dedicated to each category and each run contained always a unique sequence of stimuli. 

The present protocol was implemented for 8 runs of 4 types of items: __food__, __paintings__, __faces__ and __houses__. Here, we present videos for food, painting and houses. Due to copyright restrictions, the video stimuli concerning the faces could not be provided.

Sequences of each run were randomized across sessions.

Here, we provide six videos for the three categories aforementioned, according to a specific randomization predetermined upon launching the protocol.
