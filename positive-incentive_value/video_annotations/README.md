Each video presents a sequence of visual stimuli for a single run dedicated to the evaluation of a specific category of items. There were two sets of stimuli per category. Thus, each video displays a unique sequence of stimuli. 

The present protocol was implemented for 8 runs of 4 types of items: __food__, __paintings__, __faces__ and __houses__. Here, we present six videos for food, painting and houses. Due to copyright restrictions, the video stimuli concerning the faces could not be provided.  

Because randomization of the items is predetermined upon launching the protocol, the videos are examples of possible sequences of images, as well as possible ratings, during the runs.
