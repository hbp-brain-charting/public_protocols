The user shall run firstly the script `parser\_eprime\_logtxt\_ARCHI.py` in order to extract the values concerned to the relevant paradigm descriptors. The script accepts as inputs the log files, with extension `.txt`, generated by E-Prime 2.0 Professional. Afterwards, the user shall run the script `paradigm\_descriptor\_ARCHI.py` in order to generate the descriptors as regressors-of-interest to be used for the GLM estimation.
