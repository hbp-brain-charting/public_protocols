The videos present the sequence of visual stimuli at a specific run. Such sequences were randomized between runs but not across sessions. Sequences for each run within sessions are thus different, yet the same for every participant. They were all generated beforehand by randomization of the different conditions.

Here, we provide six videos, in which half of them correspond to the run concerning the west-east session and the other one to the south-north session.
