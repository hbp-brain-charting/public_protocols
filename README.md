# Public Protocols
This repository hosts public protocols for the IBC project.  

Main directories are dedicated to the protocol(s) of one task or a group of tasks.  

Hence, the __ARCHI directory__ contains the protocols of:  
* ARCHI Standard  
* ARCHI Spatial  
* ARCHI Social    
* ARCHI Emotional    

The __HCP directory__ contains the protocols of:  
* HCP Emotion  
* HCP Gambling    
* HCP Motor  
* HCP Language    
* HCP Relational    
* HCP Social   
* HCP Working-Memory    

The __RSVP\_Language directory__ concerns only to the protocol employed for the RSVP Language task.  

Finally, each directory contains:  
1. the protocol's scripts pertaining the launch of the stimuli;  
2. video demonstrations of the sequence of events displayed at every run;  
3. documents containing instructions to the participants carried out during the training session; and  
4. scripts that parse + extract information from log files and compute the paradigm descriptors of the regressors-of-interest used in the GLM estimation. Log files are released upon launching the protocols and they contain experimental variables and behavioral data.
