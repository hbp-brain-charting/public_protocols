# public_protocols
This repository hosts public protocols for the IBC project.  

Main directories are dedicated to the protocol(s) of one task or a group of tasks.  

Hence, the ARCHI directory contains the protocols of:  
[i] ARCHI Standard;  
[ii] ARCHI Spatial;  
[iii] ARCHI Social; and  
[iv] ARCHI Emotional.  

The HCP directory contains the protocols of: 
[a] HCP Emotion;  
[b] HCP Gambling;  
[c] HCP Motor;  
[d] HCP Language;  
[e] HCP Relational;  
[f] HCP Social; and  
[g] HCP Working-Memory.  

The RSVP\_Language directory concerns only with the protocol employed for the RSVP\_Language task.  

Finally, each directory contains:  
[1] the protocol's scripts pertaining the launch of the stimuli;  
[2] video demonstrations of the sequence of events displayed at every run;  
[3] documents containing instructions to the participants carried out during the training session; and  
[4] scripts that parse + extract information from log files and compute the paradigm descriptors of the regressors-of-interest used in the GLM (log files are released upon launching the protocols and they contain experimental variables and behavioral data).
