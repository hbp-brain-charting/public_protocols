# public_protocols
This repository hosts public protocols for the IBC project.

Main directories are dedicated to the protocol(s) of one task or a group of tasks, according to the description followed in the data paper of the corresponding release. Each directory contains: [1] the protocol's scripts pertaining the launch of the stimuli; [2] video demonstrations of the sequence of events displayed at every run; [3] documents containing instructions to the participants carried out during the training session; and [4] scripts that parse + extract information from log files and compute the paradigm descriptors of the regressors-of-interest used in the GLM (log files are released upon launching the protocols and they contain experimental variables and behavioral data).
