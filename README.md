# Public Protocols
This repository hosts public protocols for the IBC project.  

Main directories are dedicated to the protocol(s) of one task or a group of tasks.  

Hence, the __ARCHI directory__ contains information about the protocols of:  
* ARCHI Standard task  
* ARCHI Spatial task  
* ARCHI Social task  
* ARCHI Emotional task  

The __HCP directory__ contains the protocols of:  
* HCP Emotion task  
* HCP Gambling task  
* HCP Motor task  
* HCP Language task  
* HCP Relational task  
* HCP Social task  
* HCP Working Memory task      

The __RSVP\_Language directory__ concerns only to the protocol employed for the RSVP Language task.  

Finally, each directory are structured as follows:  
1. the protocol's scripts pertaining the launch of the stimuli;  
2. video demonstrations of the sequence of events displayed at every run;  
3. documents containing instructions to the participants carried out during the training session; and  
4. scripts that parse + extract information from log files and compute the paradigm descriptors of the regressors-of-interest used in the GLM estimation. Log files are released upon launching the protocols and they contain experimental variables and behavioral data.
