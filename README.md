This repository hosts public protocols for the IBC project.  

Main directories are dedicated to the protocol(s) of one task or a group of tasks.  

Hence, the ARCHI directory contains the protocols of:  
* ARCHI Standard;  
* ARCHI Spatial;  
* ARCHI Social; and  
* ARCHI Emotional.  

The HCP directory contains the protocols of:  
* HCP Emotion;  
* HCP Gambling;  
* HCP Motor;  
* HCP Language;  
* HCP Relational;  
* HCP Social; and  
* HCP Working-Memory.  

The RSVP\_Language directory concerns only to the protocol employed for the RSVP\_Language task.  

Finally, each directory contains:  
1. the protocol's scripts pertaining the launch of the stimuli;  
2. video demonstrations of the sequence of events displayed at every run;  
3. documents containing instructions to the participants carried out during the training session; and  
4. scripts that parse + extract information from log files and compute the paradigm descriptors of the regressors-of-interest used in the GLM. Log files are released upon launching the protocols and they contain experimental variables and behavioral data.
