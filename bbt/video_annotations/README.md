Video annotations of the runs, for the three MRI sessions dedicated to this protocol, are available under the tab `Releases` of the repository with the tag "bbt_annotations_v1.0". The film --2005 DVD edition of the long version of the movie _The Good, the Bad and the Ugly_ dubbed to french (_Le Bon, la Brute et le Truand_ aka _BBT_)-- is displayed onto a black background as part of the stimuli presented to the participants. The movie ends with 10 seconds of a blank, black screen.
