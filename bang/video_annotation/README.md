The video contains an 8-minute edited version of the episode "Bang! You're Dead" from the TV series "Alfred Hitchcock Presents", translated into french. The film is displayed onto a gray background as part of the stimuli presented to the participants. The stimuli ends with 10 seconds of a fixation cross.

Note: Due to size limit for each uploaded file, we are only able to provide a compressed version of the original video. To prevent a great loss of video quality, we opted for a compression that does not display the original black fixation cross on the center of the screen, at the end of the movie.
