In order to run the main script for launching the training session, i.e. `gcwindow_movie_main.py`, one must copy to the current directory the input files, stored in the parent directory in the folder "val003_3min", or change the corresponding path in the script accordingly. These files are available under the tab `Releases` of the repository with the tag "clips\_val003\_v1.0".
