The video presents the stimuli presented on the first training set run of the session "Clips 1". The film is displayed onto a gray background as part of the stimuli presented to the participants. The video starts and ends always with 10-minute flickering point placed on the center of the screen, signaling the beginning and end of the run, respectively.
