Video annotations of the training and test runs of this protocol are available under the tab "Releases" of the repository. The movies are displayed onto a gray background as part of the stimuli presented to the participants. The video starts and ends always with 10-minute flickering point placed on the center of the screen, signaling the beginning and end of the run, respectively.
