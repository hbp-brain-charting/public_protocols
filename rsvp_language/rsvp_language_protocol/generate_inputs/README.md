## Script to generate the inputs for the RSVP Language task  

Author: Ana Luisa Pinho

Compatibility: Python 2.7  

To generate the inputs, please run the script __geninputs.py__. 
It will create __cond*__ and __inputs*__ files. The first ones contain the sentences grouped by category. The second ones contain the sentences in a shuffled order to be used in the protocol held by the script __language.py__ (please, check the directory __langexpy_script__).

To generate the files containing a pre-specified sequence according to the category of the sentence (condition) and type of probe per block, please run __sentseq.py__.
