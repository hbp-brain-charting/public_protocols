## Script for extraction of paradigm descriptors from the RSVP-Language task  

### General instructions  

Author: Ana Luisa Pinho  
E-mail: ana.pinho@inria.fr  

Compatibility: Python 2.7 / log files from Expyriment 0.7.0 (Revision 7a6b73d)  

The script takes the log files with the extension .xpd that are generated by Expyriment under the data folder. Currently, the script accepts the following tree-directory structure for the log files (i.e. the inputs):

__./sub-<number\_of\_the\_participant\_with\_two\_digits>/raw/data/<name\_of\_the\_log\_file>.xpd__  

The tree-directory structure can be changed in the script.
